        <p>Golden seared juicy beef strips smothered in sour cream mushroom gravy, an easy 30 minute recipe.</p>
        <h3 class="subheading">Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>600g scotch fillet steak</li>
            <li>2 tbsp vegetable oil</li>
            <li>1 large onion</li>
            <li>300g mushrooms</li>
            <li>40g butter</li>
            <li>2 tbsp flour</li>
            <li>2 cups beef broth</li>
            <li>1 tbsp Dijon mustard</li>
            <li>2/3 cup sour cream</li>
            <li>Salt and pepper</li>
        </ul>
        <h3 class="subheading">Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Flatten steak</strong> - Use your fist (or rolling pin or mallet) to flatten the steaks to about 3~4cm thick. Slice into 5mm strips (cut long ones in half), discarding excess fat. Sprinkle with a pinch of salt and pepper.</li>
            <li><strong>Sear beef</strong> - Heat 1 tbsp oil in a large skillet over high heat. Scatter half the beef in the skillet. <em>QUICKLY</em> spread it with tongs. Leave untouched for 30 seconds until browned. Turn beef quickly. Leave untouched for 30 seconds to brown. Immediately remove onto a plate. Don't worry about pink bits and that it will be raw inside. Add remaining 1 tbsp oil and repeat with remaining beef.</li>
            <li><strong>Butter, onions, mushrooms</strong> - Turn heat down to medium high. Add butter, melt. Then add onions, cook for 1 minute, then add mushrooms. Cook mushrooms until golden. Scrape bottom of fry pan to get all the golden bits off.</li>
            <li><strong>Flour and broth</strong> - Add flour, cook, stirring, for 1 minute. Add half the broth while stirring. Once incorporated, add remaining broth.</li>
            <li><strong>Sour cream and mustard</strong> - Stir, then add sour cream and mustard. Stir until incorporated (don't worry if it looks split, sour cream will "melt" as it heats).</li>
            <li><strong>Creamy</strong> - Bring to simmer, reduce heat to medium low. Once thickens to consistency of pouring cream (3 - 5 minutes), adjust salt and pepper to taste.</li>
            <li><strong>Finishing touches</strong> - Add beef back in (including plate juices). Simmer for 1 minute, then remove from stove immediately.</li>
            <li><strong>Serve</strong> - Serve over pasta or egg noodles, sprinkle with chives if desired.</li>
        </ol>
