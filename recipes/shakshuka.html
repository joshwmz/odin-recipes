            <li>1 tbsp tomato paste</li>
            <li>1/2 cup chicken or vegetable broth (or water)</li>
            <li>1 tsp EACH paprika and cumin</li>
            <li>1/4 tsp EACH black pepper and cayenne pepper</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp salt</li>
            <li>4 eggs</li>

            <li>Pita or crusty bread, to serve</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Preheat</strong> - Preheat oven to 180c (if intending to bake them).</li>
            <li><strong>Garlic and onion</strong> - Heat oil in a medium size cast iron skillet over medium high heat. Add garlic and onion, cook for 2 minutes until onion is translucent.</li>
            <li><strong>Capsicum and tomatoes</strong> - Add capsicum, cook for 1 minute. Add diced tomato, cook for 2 minutes until broken down and it becomes a bit pasty.</li>
            <li><strong>Add and mix</strong> - Add canned tomatoes, tomato paste, broth, paprika, cumin, salt and pepper. Mix to combine well.</li>
            <li><strong>Cook and thicken</strong> - Lower stove to medium low and simmer for 5 minutes until just thickened enough to make indentations (don't want dry sludge, needs to be saucy).</li>
            <li><strong>Eggs</strong> - Make indentations in the mixture and carefully crack the eggs in. Leave to cook for 1 minute until edges of whites are set.</li>
            <li><strong>Bake or steam</strong> - Transfer to oven and bake for 7 to 12 minutes until whites are just set but yolks are still runny (or to your taste). <em>OR</em> cover with lid and steam on stove for 3 minutes (runny yolks), or just simmer them without a lid.</li>
            <li><strong>Serve</strong> - Remove from oven/stove and serve immediately, scattered with the coriander or parsley. Serve with crusty bread, or pita bread.</li>
        </ol>
