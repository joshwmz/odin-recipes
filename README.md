# odin-recipes
A website for my favourite recipes

Note to future self:

This website is a collection of recipes that I want to make. I would like to demonstrate a strong foundations of HTML once I have completed this project. This includes working with elements and tags, working with text, lists, links and images. I am also committed (no pun intended) to develop good habits in writing commit messages and be a good collaborator as a future software developer.
